# MEMORY.md - Long-Term Memory

_Your curated memories. The distilled essence, not raw logs._

## How to Use

- **Daily notes** go in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term memory** goes here — decisions, context, lessons learned
- Periodically review daily files and distill what's worth keeping

## What to Store

- Significant events and decisions
- User preferences and patterns
- Lessons learned from mistakes
- Important context that shouldn't be lost
